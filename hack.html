          <b>Women safety in India is widely discussed everywhere nowadays. It has now become a major issue. The crime rate is on the spike. Women are neither safe outside nor at home. Women travelers from other countries are also in a dubious state while thinking about coming to India. However, this fear cannot keep them away from any kind of social activity. There are laws but there should be proper safety measures which we have to follow strictly to protect the women from violence.Along with essays on Women's safety in India, there are many other sample essays being provided on our site and mobile app as well. Take a look into it for further reference.According to the National Crimes Records Bureau (NCRB), India recorded 88 rape cases every day in 2019.

        <p><b><em> conclusion, women can be powerful actors for peace, security, and prosperity. When they participate in peace processes and other formal decision-making processes, they can play an important role in initiating and inspiring progress on human rights, justice, national reconciliation and economic revitalization. They can also build coalitions across ethnic and sectarian lines and speak up for marginalized and minority groups. Investing in women's leadership is therefore smart security as well as smart development</b></em></p>
